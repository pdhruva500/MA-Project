        <h1 class="outlinebox">History of Competitive Swimming</h1>
        <div class="outlinebox">
            <p class="p1">The development of modern swimming strokes revolutionized competitive swimming in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. One of the key figures in this transformation was an Australian swimmer named Richard Cavill. He introduced the front crawl stroke, also known as the freestyle stroke, which quickly became the preferred technique due to its speed and efficiency.</p>

            <p class="p1">The front crawl stroke involved swimming face down in the water and using an alternating arm movement combined with a flutter kick. This technique allowed swimmers to generate more power and swim at a faster pace. It soon became the dominant stroke in competitive swimming and is still widely used today.</p>

            <p class="p1">Other modern swimming strokes, such as the butterfly and backstroke, also emerged during this period. The butterfly stroke was inspired by the movements of the dolphin and became an official stroke in the 1950s. The backstroke, on the other hand, involves swimming on the back and using alternating arm movements. These new strokes added variety and excitement to competitive swimming, further enhancing its popularity.</p>

            <p class="p1">Another significant development in competitive swimming rules was the introduction of time-based records. In the early years of the sport, competitions were often judged based on subjective criteria, such as style and form. However, as swimming evolved into a more competitive discipline, the need to measure performances objectively and set records became essential.</p>
