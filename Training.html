		<div class="outlinebox">
			<p class="p1"><b>Structured Training Plan:</b> A strong training program combines regular swimming workouts for technique, endurance, and speed with dryland exercises for strength, flexibility, and core conditioning. Interval training should also be included to simulate race pace, build cardiovascular fitness, and improve recovery.</p>
			
			<p class="p1"><b>Stroke Technique and Efficiency:</b> Technique is improved through feedback and drills. Coaches can help refine freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly. Stroke-specific drills build muscle memory, coordination, and smoother mechanics that reduce drag and increase efficiency.</p>
			
			<p class="p1"><b>Nutrition and Hydration:</b> Performance depends on fueling the body with lean proteins, complex carbohydrates, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals. Staying hydrated with water or sports drinks before, during, and after training replaces fluids and electrolytes lost through sweat and supports recovery.</p>
			
			<p class="p1"><b>Rest and Recovery:</b> Progress comes with proper recovery. Rest days prevent overtraining and injuries, while quality sleep supports muscle repair, hormone balance, and mental clarity â€” all essential for long-term improvement.</p>
			
			<p class="p1"><b>Mental Preparation:</b> Competitive swimming also requires mental strength. Visualization, goal-setting, and positive self-talk build confidence and focus. Mentally rehearsing starts, turns, and finishes primes both body and mind for race-day performance.</p>
